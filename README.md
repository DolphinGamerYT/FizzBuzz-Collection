# FizzBuzz-Collection
A FizzBuzz app for every language I know, and I'll learn.

## Main Idea
I though it would be cool for someone crossed my GitHub, and sees this repository, thay will know how many programming languages I know at the moment.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this comes from a video made by the one and only Tom Scott -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc

### Python
Python version was done the date 27/12/2020 at 9:59 PM (UTC+01). This is when the idea was born. Here you have the repl.it of Python -> https://repl.it/@DolphinGamerYT/FizzBuzz-Python

### Dart
Dart version was done the date 29/12/2020 at 4:16 PM (UTC+01). This means that the FreeCodeCamp 2 hours tutorial worked :Yay:. Here you have the repl.it of Dart -> https://repl.it/@DolphinGamerYT/FizzBuzz-Dart

### Java
Java version was done the date 13/1/2020 at 9:18 PM (UTC+01). Java was the first language I learned 4 years ago. Here you have the repl.it of Java -> https://repl.it/@DolphinGamerYT/FizzBuzz-Java
