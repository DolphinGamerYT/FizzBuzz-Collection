# FizzBuzz-Collection
A FizzBuzz app for every language I know, and I'll learn.

## Main Idea
I though it would be cool for someone crossed my GitHub, and sees this repository, thay will know how many programming languages I know at the moment.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this comes from a video made by the one and only Tom Scott -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc

### Python
Python version was done the date 27/12/2020 at 9:59 PM (UTC+01). This is when the idea was born. Here you have a repl.it to the version -> https://repl.it/@DolphinGamerYT/FizzBuzz-Python
